1. Will check that a new list has a length of zero
2. Will check that the size method returns the number of elements in the list
3. Will check that adding an object at index -1 will throw an indexoutofboundsexception
4. Will check that adding an object outside of the current size of the list will throw an indexoutofboundsexception
5. Will check that adding an object at the beginning of a list given the index 0 will behave accordingly
6. Will check that the add(object) method will append to the end of the list
7. Will check that an add to the middle will shift the other elements accordingly
8. Will check that a get from an empty list will throw indexoutofboundsexception
9. Will check that a get from a negative index will throw indexoutofboundsexception
10. Will check that a valid get will behave accordingly
11. Will check that a valid remove(object) will remove the object specified
12. Will check that a valid remove(index) will remove the object specified
13. Will check that a remove(index) from an index outside of the list will throw indexoutofboundsexception
14. Will check that a remove(index) from a negative index will throw indexoutofboundsexception
15. Will check that valid set will behave accordingly
16. Will check that a set in an index outside of the list will throw indexoutofboundsexception
17. Will test that a clear will remove all elements from the list
18. Will test that a clear will remove all elements from the list using the isEmpty method
19. Will make sure that the equals method will actually compare the elements of two lists
